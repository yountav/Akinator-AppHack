# Brainstorming
1. Pop up window that has some kind of title screen
2. Click on a button or press a key to get to the actual guessing game
3. The bot will start with an initial guess. Then the user will select from the following buttons:
    - Yes
    - No
    - Don't know
    - Probably
    - Probably Not
4. With every question answered, there will be some sort of tally in order to determine which character it is
    - Maybe have 5 or 8 points to be the max needed to determine a character. 
    - If there is a tie between two characters, the bot will select one. If it is an incorrect guess, then the user wins.
5. For whoever wins (user or bot), there is a "win"/"lose" screen
